# WP-DEMO-TASK-FILM

Good day,

This is the completed WordPress film demo project. 
This web application categorizes movies based on several categories that include genre and the country of origin.

On the landing page we will find a list of all movies inlcuding the plot summary and a promotional poster supplied  by IMDB .
The movie descriptions include two custom fields, namely the ticket price and the year of release.

The movies can be filtered by using the genre, year of release, actors and the country of origin.

I've used several plugins for this project and utilized the specified Unite theme.

The bulk of my personal coding is reflected on front-page.php and content-single.php to display the custom information and these are appropriately commented.

I look forward to your feedback.

Thanks,

Michael
